# Notes

This serves 4, or 2 really hungry people. The first time I made this, it was only my third wife and I. So we ate all 4 pieces of chicken and most of the spaghetti.

Substitute spaghetti for any pasta type, or omit the pasta if you prefer the chicken parmesan by itself.

For a low carb alternative, you can substitute pork rinds for the crackers and zucchini, or similar, noodles.
