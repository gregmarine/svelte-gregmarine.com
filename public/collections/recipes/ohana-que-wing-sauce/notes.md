# Notes

Toss 10 lbs of wings in sauce in a large mixing bowl to cover thoroughly.

If using this as a dip, cut ingredients in half as this recipe was designed for the wings to be tossed and well coated.

Try this sauce with my [Perfect Chicken Wings (Oven)](/recipes/perfect-chicken-wings-oven/overview)!
