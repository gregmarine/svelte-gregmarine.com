# Notes

You can actually use any thinly sliced lunch meat and seasoning for this. The ones in this recipe are for an Italian style salad.

If you like pickled onions like I do, I highly recommend using those as a replacement for the chopped onion. Since I'm really the only one in my family that likes them, I almost always use chopped onions.

Any salad dressing is fine. The olive oil works great with this, however.

Feel free to sprinkle some salt and pepper on your salad for added flavor. I prefer not to. But like the pickled onions, it is a personal preference.

Toss some nuts and olives on this salad to make it next level!
