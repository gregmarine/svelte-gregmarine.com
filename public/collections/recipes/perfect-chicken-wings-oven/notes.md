# Notes

Baking at 250F on the bottom rack allows the fat to begin to render and draws out the extra moisture to the skin due to the baking powder. Then baking at the higher temp of 400F does the actual cooking of the chicken inside.

This serves enough wings for 2 people. Multiply everything by how many you need to serve based on this recipe.

Try these wings with my favorite wing sauce recipe, [Ohana-que](/recipes/ohana-que-wing-sauce/overview)!
