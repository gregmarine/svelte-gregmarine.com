    "text": "Most people I know absolutely loves chicken wings! It can be quite an expensive treat if we always go out to a restaurant to get them. So, I decided I would learn how to make them myself. After a lot of trial and error, I have developed what I think is the perfect way of making them at home. They have become so popular in my extended family, I have also gone on to make them for Super Bowl parties! The greatest compliment I have received for these is that there is never any leftovers! If you want crispy wings that scale to any size dinner or party, this is the recipe you want!"

This time I loved it! Then, in May 2018, I took a class on how to make the rice and do sushi rolls. Since I am a bit of a \"home chef\" and owner of an Instant Pot, I naturally wanted to find a way to make the sushi rice in my Instant Pot. This recipe is the result of my love for cooking and to save money making sushi at home!"

This homemade dish is full of flavor, texture, and all the love I can pressure into this Instant Pot meal! This is not only the best I could come up with, I honestly feel this is the best chicken & noodle recipe I have ever had."
