    "text": "My favorite attraction at the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida is by far the Carousel of Progress. It most certainly is not a thrill ride. Nor is it a ride from one of the Disney movies and one unlikely to become a movie. So, why would it be my favorite, and by far nonetheless? The answer may surprise some. For fans of Walt Disney, the answer will no doubt make perfect sense."

    "text": "Like many people my age, my body has gone through many sizes over the years. As a teen and young adult, I weighed between 115 and 125 pounds. I was quite active and was able to eat just about anything I wanted. I almost had to so I could keep on weight. According to stories I heard long after this time, I was apparently quite the looker. Girls wanted me but never told me!"
