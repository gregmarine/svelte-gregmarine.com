# World Showcase Movie Series

On October 1, 1982, Epcot officially opened at the Walt Disney World Resort as the second park and first expansion of the resort. Although it was not quite what Walt Disney himself had envisioned for his Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow, one key aspect was implemented. As part of his vision, he wanted an international shopping center comprised of pavilions where the citizens of EPCOT could shop and enjoy culture from all of the world. When Epcot was finally designed and built after Walt's death, Imagineers created what is now known as the World Showcase. This multicultural marketplace surrounds World Showcase Lagoon and is the home to a permanent world's fair of 11 pavilions and 1 outpost.

I do not have many memories of enjoying the World Showcase from my childhood. However, as an adult, I have enjoyed visiting each pavilion, sampling the food, drinks, and culture, and interacting with the many Cast who are from each of the represented countries. And thanks to the many festivals Epcot has each season, the food and drinks vary throughout the year. So, regardless how many times I have visited each year, there is always something new. This has made Epcot one of my "must do's" on each trip.

Shortly after the resort temporarily closed in 2020, I had to quickly find ways of coping with not only the pandemic, but also the fact I had no idea when I would be able to visit the Walt Disney World Resort again. I really wanted to enjoy the Flower and Garden Festival as I had in years past, but the closing took place right as that festival was beginning. I knew without any doubt it would not reopen in time for me to enjoy it that year. One of the first coping ideas I came up with was the result of that timing. The World Showcase Movie Series is the idea of watching one of the Disney cartoons based on stories from each of the countries represented in the World Showcase pavilions.

The following are the pavilions and the movies I chose to represent each.

# Conclusion

These are just the 12 movies I chose at the time. Many of the countries have additional movies based on their culture to choose from. I will be enjoying this concept many times for the rest of my life and will choose different movies each time; with the exception of countries which only have 1 or a few movies that represent their culture. Sometimes with cartoons and sometimes live action. This concept can also be applied to each of the 3 other parks from the Walt Disney World Resort. The Magic Kingdom has many attractions that have movie counterparts. Disney's Hollywood Studios has Star Wars, Toy Story, and Indiana Jones, to name a few. And Disney's Animal Kingdom has many areas such as Africa, Asia, and Dinosaur Land USA which all have movies that will fit them well.

This is one of many new habits and coping mechanisms I acquired during the events of 2020. And this is certainly one I want to share with others. Any Disney fan who loves the Walt Disney World Resort as I do will definitely find this to be an entertaining way to enjoy the magic from home. I'm really looking forward to expand this idea to the other parks and would love to hear how others apply this.
