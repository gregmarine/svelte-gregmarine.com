I have been around long enough to have had several passions over the years. Some have come and gone while others have stuck around. Writing, for example, has always been a passion of mine. Whereas keychain collecting, while it was a serious hobby for years, is something I no longer go out of my way to do.


There are many definitions for the word passion. In this context, I am referring to “an object of desire or deep interest.” Having something that draws out our deepest interests and desires can motivate us to achieve a kind of happiness we all hope to obtain. For the most part, we tend to follow our passions in hobby form. However, one can also follow a passion through their job.


One of my deepest passions is to help enable others do what they do best. As software development affects most people and is one of my strongest skills, it seems only natural I would use it to help others. Therefore, I have chosen a career in software development. I use my skills as a software engineer to solve complex systems that others can use to help them. I do this both in my day job and for the open-source community.


Another important passion I have is encouraging and motivating others. As in software development, I can use my skills in writing these words to take my own experiences and encourage you on your own path. In fact, since you are reading this now, I feel I have achieved chasing one of my passions!


I feel it is important to find what drives you. One way I have found to help me find this, I try new things and experiences. This is not always an easy thing to do, however. So, start small and expand as you feel comfortable. A great way to start down this pass is to find a hobby that brings you joy. And if you can do one of your hobbies as a source of income, that is a great thing as well.


To help maintain happiness, I find it important to have multiple passions. And in the case of my doing software development as a day job, I also work on personal side projects so I can keep that passion alive when work becomes stressful. I also maintain a desktop Zen Garden, Penjing, and Bonsai in my at-home office. Combining passions has also had a lasting effect. But whatever your passions are, chase after them and find what makes you happy.
