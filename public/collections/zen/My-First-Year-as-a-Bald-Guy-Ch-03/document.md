One of the highlights of my childhood was when I would be involved in a solo or group activity, my parents would be in the audience or spectator stands. As a child, it was exciting to be doing something that I knew would make my them proud. Every church play or musical, every ballgame, every show choir performance, one or both of my parents would be there to support and cheer me on.


I completely understand what they must have felt at the time. As a parent myself, I love to support my son in his various activities. And as he grows older, I am so proud of the man he is becoming.


A parent’s job does not simply end by supporting their children. Something my own parents taught me was how to support myself. This process began as I learn the basics of self-care, such as brushing my teeth and taking showers. It then went on to doing my own laundry, learning how to cook food, and setting a budget. But it did not stop there. I was taught how to believe in myself.


The most valuable lesson they were teaching me when they would enroll me into such things as choir was the find out what sort of passions I would have as I grew older. And their support by being present in the audience was to show how proud they were of the effort I was putting into those things. This equated into my mind as, if I do my best, I should be proud of whatever the outcome will be.


I eventually found software engineering to be my passion. My dad introduced me to computer programming in the mid-1980’s when he showed me a set of BASIC programs from one of his books for a computer he owned. I was fascinated by the syntax of the language and how it would manipulate the computer into doing all sorts of magical things. Those early years of computer programming helped me build confidence because my dad showed great interest in my ability to adapt different example code to build complex applications. This eventually inspired me to turn a hobby into a career.


I appreciate all the support I received from my parents over the years. And although it feels incredible to have them believe in me, I’m most thankful they taught me how to believe in myself. My greatest potential cannot be realized if I only focus on what others think of me. That is not to say I should ignore others belief in me and my abilities. It simply means I should take that energy and pursue the next level.


I will always be a work in progress. And I truly believe my best is yet to come. I could not have gotten this far on my own. But I will not be able to get where I am going without also believing in myself. People come and go from our lives. The one constant that will always be with you is yourself. Believe in you and who you are, and I know you will become the best version of you!
