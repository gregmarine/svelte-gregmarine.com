One of the most seemingly rhetorical statements I have ever made to my son has been, “We have to do the things we don’t want to do in order to do the things we do what to do.”  When I have told him this, it was almost always at a time when he did not want to do something. 


The simple truth is, I am more like my son than I really care to admit in this area. I cannot count how many times I really do not want to do something. And in some instances, I honestly did not do the “thing.” No matter how old I get, there seems to always be moments when I feel it is not worth the effort to do many tasks and responsibilities.


However, I can with confidence say that it all does become well worth when it leads to being able to do those things I really do want to do. Whether it be working to provide for my family or mowing the lawn to care for my property, I can almost always find something that makes everything worth doing.

Let us examine the need to work at a job to maintain a lifestyle of some sort. Although some find jobs they truly enjoy, I personally do not know anyone who loves to work so much that they are willing to do so without some sort of compensation. Money and benefits help to provide the needs of one and their loved ones. It is a necessity in most cultures to earn money through the work they do.

So, even if they truly love their job, the mere fact that one needs to work often means they will be asked to do things they really do not want to do. Of course, this is not a universal truth. But in my experience, no one I know wants to always be working. For most, it would seem, sees it being a means to an end.

I do love my work. By trade, I am a software engineer and get to do amazing things and work with some of the greatest technologies. However, of my motivations to do it for my job the income potential. And that income goes to providing my family what it needs and allows them to enjoy frequent vacations to such places as the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida.

I have so many things I really want to do in life. But first, I will do many things I do not necessarily want to do so I can provide for my family, accomplish my goals, and enjoy time traveling this wonderful world.
